# V3RSUS | MMA Predictive Analytics

**Live demo: [v3rsus.vercel.app](https://v3rsus.vercel.app/)**

Ensemble machine learning engine that predicts UFC fight outcomes using career stat differentials across 6,500+ historical bouts.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python backend/app.py
# open http://localhost:2102
```

## What It Does

Pick two fighters. V3RSUS pulls their career-wide stats, computes the gap between them across dozens of dimensions, and runs an ensemble of classifiers to predict the winner. Each prediction includes:

- Win probability with per-model breakdown
- Top factors driving the call, ranked by impact
- Edge analysis across striking, grappling, physical, and experience categories
- Full fighter stat profiles and head-to-head comparison
- Historical matchup results if the fighters have fought before

## How It Works

1. Look up each fighter's most recent career-wide stats from the dataset
2. Compute differential features (Fighter 1 stat − Fighter 2 stat)
3. Standardize against training data distribution
4. Multiple models independently produce win probabilities; their mean is the final prediction
5. Explanation engine decomposes the logistic regression output to surface the top contributing factors

Models are trained on 6,528 UFC fights with 5-fold cross-validation. Ensemble accuracy is ~60%, competitive with academic ML studies on MMA (58–68% range). Vegas sits at ~65–70% with access to camp intel, injuries, and insider info we don't have.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML / CSS / JS. Instrument Serif + Inter Tight + IBM Plex Mono |
| Backend | Python, Flask, Flask-CORS |
| ML | scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) |
| Data | pandas, numpy, 6,500+ UFC fights from ufcstats.com |
| Deploy | Vercel (serverless Python) |
